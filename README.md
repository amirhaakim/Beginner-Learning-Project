# Beginner-Learning-Project
Overview of HR Attrition Trends Analysis

This project is a beginner-level HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, aimed at identifying attrition patterns across roles, departments, office locations, and genders. The dashboard was created as part of my learning journey into data analytics, focusing on foundational skills such as data cleaning, data modeling, DAX and visualization design.

Project Overview

The dataset includes general employee background information such as role, department, salary, benefits, and employment status. However, this project focuses specifically on high-level attrition trends to answer the following business question:

"Which gender, departments, roles, and office locations experience the highest attrition rates?"
"What are the relations of the employees' satisfaction levels with the attrition rates?"
"What is the attrition number throughout the 2023 season, month to month level?"

Tools Utilized
1. Microsoft Power BI (for data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization)
2. Microsoft Excel (for initial data cleaning)

Key Tasks Performed
1. Data Cleaning via Power Query Editor
2. Data Transformation to structure data for dashboarding
3. Data Modeling by establishing relationships between tables
4. Data Visualization to present key insights in a clear and concise way

Key Learnings

Iterative Workflow: Dashboard development is not a one-way process. I learned to switch frequently between data transformation and visualization phases as new requirements or errors surfaced.

Calculated Metrics Matter: Key business metrics such as attrition rate and total active headcount were not available by default and had to be derived using DAX.

Simplicity for Stakeholders: A good dashboard prioritizes clarity. Overly complex visuals often lead to confusion. Simplicity and focus are crucial for stakeholder understanding.
